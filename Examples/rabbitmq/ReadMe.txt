This code example was created for use in conjunction with a .NET User Group Presentation on Rabbit MQ.  It is intended for educational purposes.  No guarantee is given on the usefulness of the code.

Much of the code has been derived from either "RabbitMQ Essentials" by David Dossot or from the dotnetcodr website.
